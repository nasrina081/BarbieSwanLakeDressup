Description:
The **Barbie Swan Lake Dress-Up** project emerged as a collaborative endeavor during Google's Computer Science Summer Institute. Crafted using JavaScript and grounded in fundamental programming concepts like variables, data types, and functions, this project became a nostalgic ode to the classic click-to-dress-up games of the early 2000s.

As a team, we embarked on the journey to create an engaging dress-up game inspired by the cherished memories of our childhood. The goal was to captivate Barbie enthusiasts of all ages, rekindling the joy of virtual dress-up that many of us experienced in the past. Throughout its development, we explored diverse aspects of software engineering, delving into product design, resume enhancement, and preparation for software engineering interviews.

Our project signifies the fusion of creativity and coding prowess, allowing us to channel our technical skills into an interactive experience that resonates with Barbie fans and gaming enthusiasts alike. The **Barbie Swan Lake Dress-Up** game invites players to relive the charm of classic dress-up games while embracing the spirit of nostalgia and innovation.

Join us on this journey down memory lane as we celebrate the enduring allure of Barbie and the golden era of interactive web games.
